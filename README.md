#Moonlight Embedded

This branch has changes allowing the code to be compiled on Raspbian Wheezy.

Moonlight is an open source implementation of NVIDIA's GameStream, as used by the NVIDIA Shield,
but built for Linux/OSX/Windows.

Moonlight Embedded allows you to stream your full collection of Steam games from
your powerful Windows desktop to your embedded system, like Raspberry Pi, CuBox-i and Hummingboard.

For a demo see this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRW6O0bSHNw).

##Features

* Streams Steam and all of your games from your PC to your embedded system.
* Use mDNS to scan for compatible GeForce Experience (GFE) machines on the network.
* Qwerty Keyboard, Mouse and Gamepad support
* Support Raspberry Pi and i.MX 6 devices

##Requirements

* [GFE compatible](http://shield.nvidia.com/play-pc-games/) computer with GTX 600/700/900 series GPU (for the PC you're streaming from)
* High-end wireless router (802.11n dual-band recommended) or wired network
* Geforce Experience 2.1.1 or higher

##Quick Start

* Ensure your machine and embedded system are on the same network
* Turn on Shield Streaming in the GFE settings
* Start Moonlight Embedded with pair
* Accept the pairing confirmation on your PC
* Start Moonlight Embedded with stream
* Play games!

## Packages
Prebuilt binary packages for Raspbian Wheezy are available, add this line to your */etc/apt/sources.list*
```
deb http://archive.itimmer.nl/raspbian/moonlight wheezy main
```

Install package using the following commands
```
apt-get update
apt-get install moonlight-embedded
```

Source package for ArchLinux is available in [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/moonlight-embedded/)

Prebuilt binary packages for ArchLinux ARM are available, add those lines to you */etc/pacman.conf*
```
[moonlight]
Server = http://archive.itimmer.nl/archlinux/$repo/os/$arch
SigLevel = Optional
```

Install package using the following command
```
pacman -Sy moonlight-embedded
```

##Compile (these instructions for compiling on Raspbian and are slightly different from upstream)

* Install dependencies ```sudo apt-get install cmake libopus-dev libexpat1-dev libjs-jquery libssl-dev libasound2-dev libudev-dev libavahi-client-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev```
* Raspbian Wheezy (Stable) doesn't ship with libevdev which is a requirement. Download and install the libevdev packages from the Raspbian "Jessie" repos:
```
wget http://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian/pool/main/libe/libevdev/libevdev-dev_1.4.2%2bdfsg-1_armhf.deb
wget http://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian/pool/main/libe/libevdev/libevdev-tools_1.4.2%2bdfsg-1_armhf.deb
wget http://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian/pool/main/libe/libevdev/libevdev2_1.4.2%2bdfsg-1_armhf.deb
sudo dpkg -i libevdev*
```
=======
##Compile and install

* Download and extract Moonlight Embedded from release or git clone
* Install development dependencies (see Dependencies)
* Initialize the git submodules ``git submodule update --init``
